This folder contains raw data for the Michigan and Card application in the `card` and `michigan`
folders.

The original sources of the data are as follows:

 - The raw DHS data can be downloaded from [DHS Program](https://dhsprogram.com/data/)
 - The Michigan data can be downloaded from the [Survey of Consumers SDA Archive](https://data.sca.isr.umich.edu/sda-public/cgi-bin/hsda?harcsda+sca)
 - The original Card dataset is available on his website. The additional variables are available from the [NLSYM]().

 The DHS data, however, was obtained in cleaned form from Marshall Burke's lab. As a result, the
 raw data used to construct the cleaned data is not available. 

### DHS Data

1. `water_qual`, rated from 1 to 4
